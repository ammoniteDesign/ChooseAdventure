# ChooseAdventure

 I am creating a "Choose Your Own Adventure" engine which consumes a book in JSon form.

## Features:

1. **Cheating** Since what fun is a Choose Your Own Adventure book if you can't flip to a random page or choose a "path" that you don't have the correct inventory for?
2. **Inventory and Gold** This makes the "paths" harder in that there are checks against inventory for some of them. You can lose and gain inventory and gold. There's even inventory that you can only get via certain choices.
3. **Luck** Sometimes life doesn't go your way. This will be expressed via a digital six sided number generator. AKA a die.
4. **Status Effects** Hey, when you're hurt you can't do stuff as well. This is a +/- modifier on your die rolls.

##Wish List:

1. **Undo** You can undo your last move. This would be awesome.
2. **Graphic Design** People have an unconscious bias for things that have good graphic design. I would bet that between a program with awesome functionality/crappy design vs a program with crappy functionality/awesome design. People will use the crappy functionality one. This is because humans are easily swayed by pretty.
